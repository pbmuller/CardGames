Euker Rules:

	# 9's and up with aces
	# trump suit
	# dealt in two's and three's alternating, all players get 5.
	# top of the last four cards (kitty) is flipped
	# The order for choosing suit is a bit intense
	# Jack of the trump is highest, Jack of same color is second highest
	# Jack of trump, Jack of color, ace, k, q, 10, 9 of trump. Face otherwise

	# Winner of hand plays next
	# at start of game, left of dealer goes.
	# you must follow the suit of the card that was played if able.
		if you don't have the suit that was played, you can play whatever suit you want.
		if you don't play trump, you lose automatically. If you play, trump you automatically win
